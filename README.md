## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to perform an analysis on a film database to guide **PProductions** in deciding which type of film should be developed next by predicting IMDb ratings.  

## Project Summary
This project is organized into two main parts, implemented in separate Jupyter notebooks:  

1. **Project Setup, pt. 1 & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Notebook: `PProductions_EDA.ipynb`  

2. **Project Setup, pt. 2 & Prediction**  
   - Notebook: `PProductions_Prediction.ipynb`
  
## Report notebook
Focuses insights and answers to questions raised in the project.

## Datasets
The project uses an enriched version of the IMDb dataset:  

1. **IMDb Dataset**  
   - Initial dataset: `desafio_indicium_imdb.csv` containing general information about films.  

2. **Data Augmentation**  
   - The IMDb dataset is enriched with budget and revenue features obtained from **The Movie Database (TMDb)**.  
   - The resulting dataset is named `imdb_tmdb.csv` and serves as the main dataset for both exploratory analysis and prediction.
